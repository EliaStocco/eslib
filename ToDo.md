# To Do
- improve documentation for all the functions
- remove old scripts
- add automatic tests with `pytest`
- implement finite difference methods for vibrational modes exploiting symmetries (as done in `phononpy`) using `spglib`
- create "backup file" for `soap.py`
- find a way to restart `fps.py` from an interrupted script
- find a way to "standardize" `DipoleModel`, `MACEModel` and `Calculator`
- find an expression for the effective mass of a normal mode
- saving to `pickle` files could have a bug
- implement a `CLI` based on `argparse` to manipulate, inspect and perform calculations on trajectories
- implement a class to deal with `i-PI` properties
