# To Do
- improve documentation for all the functions
- remove old scripts
- add automatic tests with `pytest`
- implement script to compute vibrational modes from a `replay` trajectory
- implement finite difference methods for vibrational modes exploiting symmetries (as done in `phononpy`) using `spglib`
- clean `convert-file.py` script
- create "backup file" for `soap.py`
- find a way to restart `fps.py` from an interrupted script
- find a way to "standardize" `DipoleModel`, `MACEModel` and `Calculator`
- set up scripts to compute time autocorrelation functions
