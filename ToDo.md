# To Do
- improve documentation for all the functions
- remove old scripts
- add automatic tests with `pytest`
- implement script to compute vibrational modes from a `replay` trajectory
- implement finite difference methods for vibrational modes exploiting symmetries (as done in `phononpy`) using `spglib`
